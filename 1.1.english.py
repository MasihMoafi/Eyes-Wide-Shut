[ARG-E-5]: Destruction and ruin is one of the main laws of nature; whatever it destroys cannot be a crime.
[ARG-E-6]: Nature has endowed each of us with a capacity for benevolent feelings: instead of fostering it, we must destroy it. What meaning does the pain of others have for me?
[ARG-E-7]: Even theft, incest, murder, and suicide are not inherently vices.
[ARG-E-8]: Destruction is one of the principal laws of Nature; whatever destroys cannot be a crime. How could an act that serves nature so well possibly anger it?
[ARG-E-9]: Cruelty is the first sentiment that Nature injects into all of us, and it is far from being a vice.
[ARG-E-10]: The source of all our moral errors is that ridiculous bond of brotherhood... Are we not all born alone and isolated?
